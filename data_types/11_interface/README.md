# Interface

**Defination 1** -  Interface is something which help 2 sysstem to interact with each other, without one system has to know the details of other. <br /> Or <br /> in simple term I can say, it help to acheive ABSTRACTION. 

**Defination 2** - An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behaviour of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behaviour. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.

## Key Properties of Interface:
* The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
* By default, variables in an interface are public, static, and final.
* It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
* It supports loose coupling (classes depend on behavior, not implementation).
* In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other classes must implement.
* An interface in Java defines a set of behaviours that a class can implement, usually representing an IS-A relationship, but not always in every scenario.
