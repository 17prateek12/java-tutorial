Q1 : Why file name and class name must be the same?
A1 : In java, if you define a public class, the filename must match the class name exactly (including case). If you name something else
the compiler will throw an error like class <Name> is public, should be declare in a file named Name.java

Q2 : What does public static void main(String[] args) mean?
A2 : This is entry point of java application. Let's break it:
     _________________________________________________________________________
    |
    | Part            |      Meaning
    |1. public        | Accessible from anywhere (JVM need to call it)
    |2. static        | Belongs to class, not an object (so JVM can call it without creating an object)
    |3. void          | it return nothing
    |4. main          | The name of the method JVM look for
    |5. String[] args | Accepts command-line arguments as an array of string
    |_________________________________________________________________________

Q3 : What is the difference between System.out.print and System.out.println?
A3 : System.out.print() : Print text on the same line, does not move to the next line
     O/P :  Is java fun trueIs java hard false

     System.out.println() : Print text and moves to the next line afterward
     O/P : Is java fun true
           Is java hard false

Q4 : What is difference between signed and unsigned ?
A4 :  unsigned: only positive number and zero, all bit are used for value - no bit is reserved for sign.
                unsigned range : 0 to 255, 00000000 -> 0 - 11111111 -> 255
                Unsigned is useful when you know the value will never be negative and want to maximize the positive range.
                Java does not support unsigned types for byte, short, int, or long by default
                Java treats char as unsigned 16-bit (range 0 to 65535)
                Java 8 added support for some unsigned operations using helper methods like Integer.toUnsignedString()

      signed: Can store both positive and negative numbers
              the most significant bit(leftmost) is used to indicate the sign: 0xxxxxxx -> positive number, 1xxxxxxx -> negative number
              signed range: -128 to 127
              Signed is needed for calculations with both negative and positive numbers
